				LAB FILE INSTRUCTIONS:
					- Set the <title> tag to this lesson's US English title
					- Set the <meta description tag to the US English course & lesson title
					- Add one <section></section> for each slide. Slides can contain most any valid HTML
					- Each text tag (<p> or <li> or <h1> etc.) must have a class name that begins with
						"l_" and is unique. Each of those class names must be added to the i18n/localizations.js
						file and their values must be set equal to the US English version of the strings. That 
						file is used for translation and its contents OVERRIDES the text in this file.
					- Each slide must have a <div class="slidenote"></div> container, which can be empty. These
						are used for presenter notes. They also must be given unique "l_" classnames and strings
						provided in the localizations.js file.
					- Please use inline CSS on the slides to size & arrange contents.
					- Graphics should be placed in the images folder and cropped/sized appropriately.
					- Assume a 1024 x 768 display resolution
					- A link to the index.html for each lesson must be added in order to the coursename/index.html
						title slide.

<p class="l_mission"><strong>Mission: </strong>In this lab, you will deploy an app for testing on physical devices and follow the critical steps for publishing that app to the Android Market and iTunes App Store. </p>

<p class="l_specification"><strong>Specification: </strong>You will need the following resources to complete all aspects of this lab: </p>

<ul style="width:70%">
	<li class="l_spec1">An Android device and USB cable</li>
	<li class="l_spec2">An iOS device and USB cable</li>

Create a Development Provisioning profile associating your certificate, device, and AppID. Download it to your computer. <br/><br/>

	Connect your iOS device. Using Titanium Studio, install the provisioning profile to XCode. Then install the app to your device. Test the app. It should offer the same functionality as you see in the iOS simulator. Disconnect your device following your operating system’s procedure for safely removing USB devices. 		</td>

Use tibh as the alias and titanium as the password (or use your existing password if you have a keystore already). When prompted, enter your name, company name, and location information. Use keytool to verify your keystore. <br/><br/>

	Using Titanium Studio, package the app for Android distribution. Use the keystore you created, entering the alias and password into the fields in Studio. When done, use jarsigner to verify the APK file. 		</td>

If prompted to, use zipalign to align your APK file then re-upload. Upload your two screenshots. Upload the 512x512 icon that you downloaded at the start of this lab. Name the app TiBountyHunter and enter a description of your choice. Select an application type and category, such as Games, Casual. Select Everyone (or Low Maturity) for the Content Rating. Check the two consent checkboxes to acknowledge Google’s terms and agreements. <br/><br/>

	Observe, but do not click the Save and Publish buttons. You won’t actually publish the app (the Market doesn’t need a thousand TiBountyHunter apps published by all our students). Click Delete or simply navigate away from the page to cancel. 		</td>

		<td colspan="2" class="labinstructions l_step8">8: In the iOS Dev Center, access the iTunes Connect portal. Using the Manage Your Applications page, create an app entry for TiBountyHunter, noting the correct Bundle Seed ID and Suffix. Enter a description and select Games as the Primary Category and Educational as the Subcategory. Select None for each of the audience rating options. Upload the required screenshot and large icon (from the lab’s graphic assets). Save your changes. <br/><br/>

	Open Xcode and display the Organizer window. Click the Archives button. Your packaged app should be listed. Click Validate and enter your iOS Dev Center credentials when prompted. It can take considerable time for your app to be available for validation after entering it on iTunes Connect. If that process hasn't finished, the validation will fail with an “app not found” message.  <br/><br/>

	Do not upload the app. Apple will likely reject the app and the App Store doesn’t need lots of copies of TiBountyHunter anyway.</td>
