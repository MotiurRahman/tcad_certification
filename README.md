## Instructions

1. Download a copy of [presentation-engine](https://github.com/appcelerator-training/presentation-engine) to a suitable directory on your computer.
2. Download a copy of the course slides to that same directory so that you end up with a structure like this:

```
some_folder  
   - presentation-engine (folder)  
   - tcad_certification (folder)  
      - index.html  <-- TOC for the whole course  
         - 000 (folder)  
            - index.html <-- TOC for the lesson  
         ... etc
```

### Running a presentation

1. Open the coursename/index.html in your browser. Safari and Chrome work best, Firefox works too.
2. Click a lesson's name, which opens the 000/index.html file for that lesson.
3. Click the "Notes" icon to open a separate window (you might need to override any pop-up blocker to see that window). That new window will display presenter notes as you step through the slides.
4. At the end of a lesson, if running Chrome, close the presenter notes window. Click the AppU logo, which will take you back to the course TOC slide. Click the next lesson's title. (If running Chrome, reopen the presenter notes window.)

### Navigating within a presentation

Press right or left arrow keys to move forward/back in a presentation. Some slides include "vertically nested" sub-slides. Such nested slides will show a down-pointing arrow. Press the down-arrow key to move through those sub-slides.

Press the Spacebar to see a partial overview of the slides in a presentation.
